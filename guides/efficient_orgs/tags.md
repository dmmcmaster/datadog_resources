# Tags

## Basics
- Tagging is one of the most important parts of Datadog. Whether they are custom tags or OOTB tags from integrations, tags are what make the correlation in Datadog so powerful. From environment variables to pod labels, there are many different ways to add tags. Choosing which way to add tags also depends on your deployment strategy, where the resource is located, etc. You can find many guides and docs on how to add tags on the Datadog docs site so, in this topic, I will mainly be summarizing different methods and linking you back to the platform.
