While working with customers, a common line of questioning I get asked revolves around organizational cleanliness. Whether new teams or business units have started using Datadog, or teams have been using it for awhile and want to clean up some old resources they created, it is important for Orgs to be - well - organized. I will walk through Datadog resources in subsequent sections to provide notes, thoughts, and tips on how to accomplish this task. I believe the [Datadog Service Catalog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/service_catalog/) is the ideal way to make sure everything is organized moving forward, however, you may need help deciding what to keep or delete or you may have started using Datadog before the Service Catalog was available.
